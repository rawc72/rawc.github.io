# Purpose of the Exercise:
The purpose of the exercise was to improve the internal structure of a source code (refract) from an original .html and .css files provided to us, while maiantaining the essence of the client's website intact.

# Complying with the Acceptance Criteria:
The criteria for acceptance, and therefore, the actions taking while refracting, are summarized below:
1. I changed all non-semantic elements into semantic elements,
2. I implemented a logical structure using semantic elements (i.e. <header>, <nav>, <article>, <sections>, <aside>, <footer<>),
3. I added accessibility attributes to the code,
4. I ensured all elements had a sequential order (i.e. <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, etc.),
5. I added a concise and descriptive title to the website.
Ultimately, the source code was cleaned up using semantic elements only, structured sequentially, added the nessesary attributes to make it accessible, and made the code more efficient in general. 


# Detailed Changes To The Code:
1. Head:
    A. Title:
        The source code did not provide a title for the website. Titles are one of the most powerful search engine ranking factors that is in the control of the website owner and/or developer. As such, I added a concise yet descriptive title - "Horiseon Services".

2. Body:
    A. Non-semantic elements:
        The source code provided was full of non-semantic elements. The original developer had excessively used the Division the tag <div> across the entire code in the .html file. In its place, I used semantic elements such as <header>, <nav>, <article>, <sections>, <aside>, <footer> in the corresponding sections in order to better describe the elements that make up the structure of the code.
    B. Accessibility:
        All images received an accessibility element (<alt>) in order to ensure people with disabilities can access the website.
    C. Navigation:
        An id selector, which was missing in the source code, was added to "search engine optimization" located in the <nav> section. This link will improve the functionality of the website.
    D. Sequencing and logical structure:
        The code was given logical structure and sequencing. The logical structure is determined by a <haed> and a <body>. Within the <body>, the <header> is followed by and <article>, followed by independent <sections> and finally a <foooter>. A <nav> element is included at the <header>. Proper sequencing can be identified when looking at the code and determining the <h1> is followed by <h2>, then <h3> and finally <h4>.
    
3. Footer:
    A.  No major changes were made in the footer with the exception of changing <h2> for <h4> to ensure proper sequencing.
