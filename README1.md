# Purpose of the Excercise

The purpose of the excercise


# Criteria of Acceptance

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

# Changes Made to the Code

1.  Eliminated all of the non-semantic elements contained within the code and replaced them with semantic
    elements only.
2.  Restructured the code so that it followed a logical sequence. The cleaned code has been structured as
    follows: <head> and <body>, and within the <body>, it is structured:
    a. <header>
    b. <nav>
    c. <section>
    d. <aside>
    e. <footer>
3.  These changes to the structure also required changes be made to the style.css file in order to provide
    the website with more flexibility and accesibility. The .css file also follows the same logic and structure
    as the .html file to allow for easier editing going forward.
4.  A title was added to the website so that the actual name of the company appeared as the URL.
5.
